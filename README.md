# Football-Predictor
Android app to 
1)enable users to predict scorelines and scorers of football matches in the BPL 2016-17 season, 
2)make customized accounts, groups, friends
3)maintain statistical data of performance and see their progress on global leaderboard. 


Frontend: Android + Java
Backend: SQL DB + PHP

To create the database you can run the file: Football-Predictor/Backend_PHP/predictor/predictor.sql

This used to be on appstore, but it is now discontinued coz the developer (ie Me) got a full time job and could not make time to continue maintaining this application.

Since the original server is now down, I request you to set up an internal WAMP server and make the requisite changes in the below files:
https://github.com/shekavi/Football-Predictor/blob/master/Frontend_Android/FootballPredictor/src/com/zombieinawaterbottle/footballpredictor/ServerParams.java
https://github.com/shekavi/Football-Predictor/blob/master/Backend_PHP/predictor/db.inc.php


The basic overview of the project (and breif description of what the files and tables do) is given in the 
Football-Predictor/Football_Predictor_Dictionary.xlsx file. I invite you to look into it before using the code.
