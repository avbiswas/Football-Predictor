<h1>PL PREDICT THE SCORELINE HELP</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to PL Predict The Scoreline Help.<br>
  <br>
You can write about any query that you may have from the Write To Us option in your app. You can access it by opening the left drawer (Swipe from left to right on the screen) and click Write To Us after you have logged in. We will try to get to you ASAP.<br>
<br>
The UI of the app is very self-explanatory. You can navigate to all the screens from your profile homepage, by opening the drawer navigation toolbar (swipe your screen left to right) and also opening the menu (by either clicking the menu button from your device or by clicking the 3 dots on right corner of the action bar).</p>
<p>Here are some FAQ for you to introduce you to the various aspects of PL Predict The Scoreline.</p>
<p><br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2>MATCHDAY:</h2>
<p>A matchday is simply one week of Premiere League. On an average a Matchday will consist of 10 matches, spread over the course of the week. On every matchday, the user can predict in the matches listed on that week. If he/she predict in all the matches, the user gets a bonus of +100 points. Failure to predict in atleast 50% of the matches will result in a penalty. In matchdays that have odd number of matches (say n) , the user needs to predict in atleast (n+1/2) number of matches. For deduction and bonus details, refer to the heading &quot;Scoring System&quot;.
<p>
<p>
<h2>NET POINTS vs PURE POINTS:</h2>
<p>Pure points are the points the user has acheived from predicting in the matches.<br>
  Net points is the points after the user is awarded with the Participation bonus or charged with the cutoff penalty.<br>
  <br>
  (User recieves a participation bonus of  <strong>100 points </strong>when he/she predicts in all the matches from a particular matchday. If the user fails to predict in atleast 50% of the matches in a matchday, he/she incurs a penalty of <strong>20 points </strong>for each match he predicts less than the cutoff. Read the Prediction Scoring System for more info.)</p>
<p><h2><strong>FRIENDS:
</strong></h2>
User can send friend request to any other user on the community. The second user needs to accept the request for the two users to be friends.<br>
<br>
Friends can view each other's profile, their group history, points history, prediction history and also  include them when creating groups.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h2> <strong>GROUPS:</strong></h2></p>
Groups can be created by the &quot;CREATE GROUP&quot; button on the Group Page. The user who creates the group can choose which friends to add in the group.<br>
<br>
<em>In the beta version, users can not add members to the group after it's inception.</em>
<p>In groups, the users are ranked only based on the <strong>pure points </strong> achieved by the group members on or after the matchdays in which the group was created. This means that if a group was created on (say) Matchday 4, the members are ranked based on the pure points accumulated by them on Matchday 4 and onwards up to Matchday 38. The pure points acheived from Matchday 1 to Matchday 3 is not considered in the evaluation of group points. This ensures an even playing field for all the members of the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SCORING SYSTEM:</h2>
<p>All prediction lines are closed 2 minutes after the scheduled start of play. No prediction will be accepted after this time. Users are advised to save their predictions long before the match starts to avoid server complications.</p>
<p>The scores will be updated and users can see their performance after the end of that matchday's games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AWARDS</strong></p>
<p>A. For correctly predicting a winner or draw : <strong>+20 points</strong></p>
<p>B. For perfectly predicting a scoreline (correct home and correct away score) :<strong> +50 points</strong></p>
<p>C. For correctly predicting  one of the side's score: <strong>+20 points</strong> (if not eligible for Award B)</p>
<p>D. For correctly predicting a scorer: <strong>+20 points</strong><br>
  <br>
E. The user will get <strong>+20 points </strong>for each correct scorer you predict.</p>
<p>F. The user will get <strong>+20 points </strong> for each goal scored by the player you predicted.</p>
<p>G. In case the user predicts 0 in a scoreline, the user can choose either &quot;PASS&quot; or &quot;NO SCORERS&quot; options. If the user chooses &quot;NO SCORERS&quot;, he/she gets <strong>+20</strong> if there are actually no scorers for that team in the match (own goals for either team is not considered), <strong>-10</strong> if there are goals for that team in the match. The user gets no awards, nor deductions if the user chose &quot;Pass&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  H. <strong>If the user predicts in ALL the listed matches in a matchday, he gets a +100 points bonus.</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DEDUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>A. For getting the score of either side's scoreline off by more than 2 goals, the user gets a <strong>-10 points </strong>deduction for every defecient goal more than 2. <br>
  <br>
(For example if an user predicts that Arsenal-Chelsea scoreline would be 1-1, but it ends up being 4-4, then the user will suffer a loss of <strong>-20 points. </strong>The breakdown is as follows: <strong>-10 </strong>for missing Arsenal's score by more than 2 goals. <strong>-10 </strong>for missing Chelsea's score by more than 2 goals. Note than if the score was 5-5, then the losses will be additive and user will suffer a loss of -40 points.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B. The user will suffer a loss of <strong>10 points </strong>for each wrong scorer he predicts.</p>
<p>C. <strong>If the user fails to predict in the minimum number of matches that he requires to predict in that matchday (50% of the total matches on that week), the user suffers a -20 point deficit for each missing match. </strong>(For example, a typical week of PL will consist of 10 matches. The user should predict in atleast 5, to avoid a penalty. If the user predicts in just 3 matches, he suffers a loss of <strong>20 X (5-3) =</strong> 40 points)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
